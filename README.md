# Hi, I'm Valdemar Farina

Technical Lead with a strong background in frontend architecture and enterprise applications.
Most of my work revolves around Angular, TypeScript and designing frontend systems that are
meant to scale, evolve and stay maintainable over time.

I usually work close to the core of the product: defining base architectures, shared libraries,
design systems and technical standards that multiple teams rely on.

I care about building software that makes sense for the business, not over-engineered solutions.
Good structure, clear boundaries and pragmatic decisions matter more to me than trends.

I also use a corporate GitHub account as part of my work at @Ryndem:

### What I usually work on

- Frontend architecture and modular design (Angular)
- Design systems and shared UI libraries
- Complex state management and async flows
- End-to-end solution design (frontend ↔ backend)
- Technical reviews and architectural alignment
- Mentoring and technical guidance

### Backend (technical leadership level)

Backend is not my primary focus, but I’m comfortable discussing and designing solutions at an
architectural level:

- API design and integration contracts
- Relational data modeling (SQL Server)
- Clean Architecture concepts
- Background processes, queues and async workflows
- End-to-end flow validation
